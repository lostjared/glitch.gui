Glitch Art Generator and Effects Processor

This application enables users to generate captivating glitch art to use as base images for AI or apply various effects to any image or video, including those generated by AI. Users can chain effects together for both images and video files, and they have the ability to save custom filters created by mixing and matching different filters and plugins. Additionally, users can opt to incorporate sound from the original source video into their edited videos. The application also offers the functionality to rotate videos between portrait and landscape orientations.

How It Works

* Input Files: Provide an example image or video file to begin the process.
* Start Animation: Initiate the desired animation effect.
* Save Output: Press the "Save" button or the shortcut key "s" to save a snapshot of the generated art.
* Record Video: Optionally, record a video file by configuring the recording settings.
* Navigation: Use the arrow keys to navigate through available distortion filters. Press "s" to save, "d" to start/stop recording, "e" to step through, or utilize the GUI buttons to perform the same operations.
* Filter Application: Note that some filters may appear to have no effect on an image initially. In such cases, select a filter that induces visible changes, press the first button, and then choose the seemingly inactive filter. This is because certain filters require an animation to execute their intended action.
