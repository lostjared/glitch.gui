This is an application that allows you to generate interesting glitch art you can use as base images for ai. Or use it the other way around process and add effects go any image or video including those generated by ai. You can apply chained effects to images as well as video files. It allows you to save your own custom filters, built from mixing and matching filters/plugins. Also you can optionally add sound to your video copying it from the original source video. It is also possible to rotate your video to portrait mode or from portrait to landscape. 

How it works:
    Supply a example image or video file, start an animation press Save or the s key to save a snapshot. You can also choose to record a video file, fill out the record setting window.
    Use the arrow keys, s to save, d to stop/start, e to step or the GUI to move through the supplied distortion filters or press the buttons in the interface that do the same operation.
Note:
    Some of the filters might seem to do nothing on an image, thats why you must select a filter that causes the image to change press the first button
    then select that filter that seemed to do nothing. The reason is, it requires an animation to preform its action.

Required libraries:
   OpenCV 4, http://github.com/lostjared/libacidcam - libacidcam, Qt6, Qt6 Web Engine Widgets (on debian qt6-webengine-dev)
